# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website using React and React-Bootstrap and hosted through Firebase.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `firebase login`

Logs in to Firebase account.

### `firebase deploy`

Deploys the latest version of the project.  

Make sure to run `npm run build` before deploying.

### `firebase hosting:channel:deploy CHANNEL_ID`

Replace CHANNEL_ID with a string with no spaces (for example, feature_mission-2-mars). This ID will be used to construct the preview URL associated with the preview channel.

Open your web app at the preview URL returned by the CLI. It will look something like this: PROJECT_ID--CHANNEL_ID-RANDOM_HASH.web.app

To update your preview URL with changes, run the same command again. Make sure to specify the same CHANNEL_ID in the command.
